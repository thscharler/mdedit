# General

Up to three leading spaces still work as expected. The fourth
makes everything a code block.

# Thematic break {#fff .as .ddf fjfjj}

At least 3 *, - or _ form a thematic break. Spaces inbetween
are ok.

# Headings I

One to six # make a heading.

# Headings II

Underlining with = makes H1, underlining with - makes a H2.

# Code blocks

* Indent at least by 4.

* Use a fence
